## 🚀 What is CollabSpace?

CollabSpace is **more than just a project** — it’s a vision.

I’ve always believed that productivity tools should do more than store notes or assign tasks. What if a platform could truly **understand your goals**, **analyze your habits**, and **help you grow** — both personally and professionally?

That’s the idea behind **CollabSpace** — a unified productivity platform designed to help individuals and teams plan, track, reflect, and improve in one seamless space.


## 💡 Why I Built This

I’ve been on a journey of deep focus and reinvention — learning full-stack development with the dream of building something impactful.

During this phase, I noticed a gap:  
Too many tools do **one** thing well.
But life and work are **not siloed** — they’re messy, dynamic, and interconnected.

I wanted to create a tool that reflects that reality.  
A space where:
- You can track your goals and tasks.
- Reflect daily with journals.
- Get AI-powered feedback.
- Collaborate with your team.
- And most importantly — **grow**.

This is my attempt at solving a **real problem** with **real technology** — and leveling up as a developer along the way.


## 🧱 Tech Stack

This project is built using:

- **Next.js** – for server-side rendering and modern React
- **Tailwind CSS** – for rapid, clean UI development
- **TypeScript** – for scalable, typed code
- **React** – to build interactive, component-based UIs
- **Node.js, Express, MongoDB** *(upcoming)* – to power full-stack functionality

## 🛣️ What’s Next?

This is just the beginning.

I’m currently building this solo — learning, designing, and iterating along the way. My goal is to turn this into a **polished MVP** that shows I can solve real-world problems as a full-stack dev.


## 🧠 My Dream

This isn’t just about code.  
It’s about proving to myself that I can create something meaningful.  
It’s about turning struggle into strength, and focus into freedom.  
If this helps even one person build their dream life — it’s already worth it.
